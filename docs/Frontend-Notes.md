# Frontend Notes — moved

The backend→frontend contract (and the frontend→backend contract) now live in a single
bidirectional source of truth:

**`C:\dev\coordinated\coordination.md`**

Do not maintain contract details here. When the backend changes an `/api/*` payload, a config gate
that alters an API response, daemon behavior the dashboard depends on, the SOC2 export layout, or the
telemetry contract, update `coordination.md` (§3–§6) in the same change. See `coordination.md` §10
(Coordination Protocol).
